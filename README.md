Hybrid methods for Parallel Betweenness Centrality on the GPU

The only dependency of this code (other than CUDA itself, of course) is Boost. A few small input examples can be found in the graphs directory. Graphs should be represented as edgelists with one edge per line.

For more information on the algorithms used in this repository, see our SC14 paper: http://users.ece.gatech.edu/~amclaughlin7/SC14_Final.pdf
